# 100 Prisoners Problem â€“ Simulation in Python

This project simulates the famous **100 prisoners problem**, demonstrating the drastic difference in survival probability between a naive random strategy and the optimal loop-following strategy.

> Based on the strategy explained in the [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA)

---

# How It Works

- Random Strategy: Each prisoner opens 50 random drawers.
- Best Strategy : Each prisoner follows a deterministic loop starting from their number.

# Results

The best strategy consistently shows a ~31% chance of all prisoners surviving.
Random Strategy consistently shows 0 % chance of all prisioners surviving.
The Result obtained is similar to the result obtained in the video.
